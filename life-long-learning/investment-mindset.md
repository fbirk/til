# Develop an Investment Mindset

> from an article by Amy Hoy on her blog [Stacking the Bricks](https://stackingthebricks.com/failure-the-hourly-mindset/)

In here blog post Hoy states, that in order to achieve real growth, one has to adopt an investment mindset. The contrary idea to this, the **Hourly Mindset**, means *"spend time, get paid for time, and so on"* or in other words you invest some fixed amount of time and receive a fixed amount of value in return. The *Investment Mindset* however means, that you invest time in such a way that you can receive an ever growing amount of value which builds up with every step of growth.

In terms of knowledge, this means, small but steady investments will build up over time.
