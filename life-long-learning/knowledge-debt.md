# Knowledge Debt

**Knowledge Debt** is a phrase coined by Amir Rachum in his [blog post](https://amir.rachum.com/blog/2016/09/15/knowledge-debt/) from 2016. By this phrase he meant, that a software programmer does not have to understand every detail of an infrastructure, technology, language and so on to use it. To quickly accomplish a task, while also using a new technology, a programmer can solve it with some try-and-error and just working it out. In this continuos cycle of learning and trying out it is possible -- or even reasonable -- to accumulate some sort of knowledge debt to quickly move on. As long as the programmer later comes back to *pay back the debt* by gaining a deeper understanding of this new technology.

> With Rachums words:  
> *'You should, intentionally and **tactically**, decide which piece of information you can do without, for now. But you should also, intentionally and **strategically**, decide when to pay back that debt.'*

As a programmer you can never stand still and be satisfied with what you know so far. But with the accumulation of some knowledge debt you can move forward in this every renewing and changing field while also learning at your own pace.
