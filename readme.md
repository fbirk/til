> Today I Learned

This repository shall serve as a personal and public journal and also source of knowledge I accumulated on a day to day basis. The repository consits out of small markdown files about a specific topic or other 'chunk of knowledge'. There are two constraints to all notes (or at least should be):
* every note should be limited to 200 words or less
* it should take 15 minutes or less to write a note

More about the concept of *public learning* can be found here: [How I Built a Learning Machine](https://dev.to/jbranchaud/how-i-built-a-learning-machine-45k9)
